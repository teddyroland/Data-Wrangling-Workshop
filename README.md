# Data-Wrangling-Workshop

The resources in this repository support the Berkeley DLab's November 10, 2015 workshop on Python and Pandas.

The workshop is designed with two goals. First, we will follow-up on Professor Paigeâ€™s talk, by looking at Python implementations of tools he had used in his talk, including spreadsheets and visualization. Second and more broadly, the workshop will build on the introduction to Python from our first workshop. We will begin with a brief refresher of the language's mechanics and then look at some new tools.

The Python script that forms the backbone of this workshop is in the IPython Notebook format and requires the Pandas package.

-IPython and Pandas are can be downloaded as part of the Anaconda platform here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads. (Select the version for Python 2.7)
